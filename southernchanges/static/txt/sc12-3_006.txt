          Three political scientists present the case for viewing education
as a "political process." They conclude that the most important
determinant of discrimination against black children is the proportion
of black teachers in the classrooms. "Without the political action
that results in more black school board members, which in turn
produces more black administrators, who in turn hire more black
teachers, second-generation discrimination against black students
would be significantly worse." This is a book that should be
useful to school reformers and administrators, especially those
equipped to deal with statistics.
