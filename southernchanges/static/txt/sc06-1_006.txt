          The Kissinger Commission report (the President's commission on
Central America) fails to recommend an alternative for Central
America. It calls for more of what has already failed.
          This failure results from flawed premises. The first is that US
national security overrides everything else. The second is the
assumption that US security can best be assured by casting the problem
as geopolitical. "The real enemy of the United States is not Russia,
but the poverty of the people," said a Central American to me
recently.
          The plight of the people is recognized by the Report, but the
solution is to depend on the same old structures and dynamics which
have been the cause of the impoverished of the region. As outlined in
this article and the following interview, there is an Alternative,
neither US capitalism nor Soviet socialism, which designs an economic
system to bring full humanity to the majority of the people. If we
really want a secure region close to our borders, then we should join
the poor in reorganizing society to meet human needs.
