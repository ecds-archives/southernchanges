          Bill Kovach, the former editor of the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, is the new curator of the Harvard-based
Nieman Foundation program of journalism fellowships.
          Kovach was a Nieman fellow himself this past year after resigning
from the Atlanta newspapers in a dispute with the owners, Cox
Enterprises, over the direction the newspapers would take and the
amount of money they would spend on the editorial
product. [Southern Changes, December 1988].
          Kovach was the editor in Atlanta from 1986-1988, following an
18-year career at the New York Times. He had also
worked for the Nashville Tennessean and the
Press Chronicle of Johnson City, Tenn.
