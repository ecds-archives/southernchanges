          The plight of Sumter County, Ala., is a good example for those who
may be considering a toxic waste facility in their community or
state. Waste Management Inc. took over the dumpsite in Emelle in
1978. They promised that the facility would bring in much-needed
industry and jobs to our economically depressed area. However, the
facts reveal otherwise.
          In 1978 Sumter County had an unemployment rate of 5.8 percent. This
figure has risen drastically to 21.1 percent. These statistics from
the Alabama Employment Service also show that Sumter County lost 2,000
from its work force from 1978 to 1986 and lost five industries.
          Another problem with people leaving our county in search of work is
that we have many homes being put on the market. Unfortunately, no one
is anxious to move to a county that has no work to offer other than a
job at a waste dump.
          Along with property devaluation, we are experiencing a crisis in
our healthcare. One hospital facility in Livingston has closed and the
other hospital in York is in serious financial difficulty and may not
survive. We have lost most of our physicians as well. Ambulance
service has been cut considerably to rural areas.
          One of the problems of living in a dying county is that there is
not enough money to go around to all the agencies which need it. Taxes
are the only recourse for additional funds. A proposed increase of the
ad valorem tax is expected to be 11 mills which will bring the rate
from 23.1 to 34.1.
          Sumter is suffering and others can learn from its example. The only
thing toxic waste facilities attract is more toxic waste.--KAY KIKER
