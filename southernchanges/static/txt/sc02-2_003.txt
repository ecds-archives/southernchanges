          There seems to be an item which slipped by all our dutiful
proofreading in the July issue of Southern
Changes probably  because the error had the sound of being
grammatically correct — but unfortunately it left an incorrect
impression — and I have promised the author, Paige Gutierrez
— that we will print the correction. The error comes on page
25, midway through the first column. It should
read "The Genteel Acadian is likely to be a speaker of standard
French, whereas the "Proud Coonass" is more likely to speak a
nonstandard Cajun dialect."
