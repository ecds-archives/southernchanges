          Uneasy Victories in the Supreme Court
          By Mcdonald, LaughlinLaughlin Mcdonald
          Vol. 8, No. 3, 1986, pp. 15-18
          
          During the 1985-1986 term, the Supreme Court decided eight major
race discrimination cases. Four involved employment discrimination and
affirmative action, three involved jury selection and the seventh
voting rights. In all eight, the basic positions (if not the specific
remedies) advocated by minorities prevailed, while the restrictive
interpretations of civil rights law urged by the Reagan Department of
Justice were decisively rejected.
          In the first of the employment cases, Wygant
v. Jackson Board of Education, the Court held that a school board
could not lay off non-minority teachers with more seniority than
minority teachers who were retained as part of an affirmative action
plan. The Court reasoned that "layoffs impose the entire burden of
achieving racial equality on particular individuals, often resulting
in serious disruption of their lives. The burden is too intrusive."
Although minority teachers were denied a measure of protection in
Wygant, the decision as a whole was a victory for affirmative
action.
          First, the Court indicated that race-conscious affirmative action
plans, including the use of hiring goals, are constitutional as part
of the nation's commitment to eradicating racial
discrimination. Second, the Court rejected the Department of Justice's
suggestion that affirmative action must be limited to 

specific,
identifiable victims of past discrimination. Since it is often
impossible to prove which particular minority would have been hired in
the absence of discrimination, the adoption of government's position
would have meant the end of meaningful affirmative action. Third, an
employer can justify an affirmative action plan by showing a
reasonable basis for concluding such a remedy is appropriate; an
employer need not have, in fact, discriminated in the past.
          In Sheetmetal Workers v. EEOC, the Court,
building upon Wygant, held that an affirmative
action plan to increase minority membership in a union could be
required in cases of "persistent or egregious discrimination" or where
necessary "to dissipate the lingering effects of pervasive
discrimination." In the third employment discrimination case, Firefighters v. City of Cleveland, the Court upheld a
voluntary affirmative action plan to hire minority firefighters even
though it may have provided broader relief than a district judge could
have ordered after a trial.
          Finally, in Bazemore v. Friday, the Court
ruled that the North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service had a
duty to eradicate salary disparities between white and black workers,
even though the disparities had their origin prior to the time federal
anti-discrimination laws were made applicable to public employers.
          The Court's employment discrimination cases are the most
significant setback to date for the Reagan Administration's five
and-a-half year crusade to eradicate hiring goals and restrict relief
to the few identifiable victims of discrimination. In rejecting the
Solicitor General's arguments, the Court frequently used strong
language accusing the government of "misconceiving" controlling legal
principles and "twisting" the meaning of applicable statutes. The
rulings of the Court suggest that the Department of Justice under its
present leadership has lost much of its institutional credibility, and
that its arguments were viewed as part of a rightwing political
campaign rather than as based upon the rule of law.
          The Supreme Court also significantly strengthened the protection of
minorities in jury selection during the last term. In Batson v. Kentucky, it held for the first time that a
prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to strike black jurors in a
particular case violated the Fourteenth Amendment. The law prior to
Batson had been established, ironically enough,
in a case decided during the years that Earl Warren was Chief Justice,
Swain v. Alabama. Swain held that a prosecutor's
use of peremptory challenges was immune from judicial review, except
were blacks were removed in "case after case, whatever the
circumstances, whatever the crime and whoever the defendant or the
victim may be."
          The Swain standard, which was all but
impossible to meet, had been increasingly criticized by legal
commentators, while a number of lower courts had circumvented the
decision by ruling that the use of challenges by a prosecutor to
exclude blacks in individual cases violated the Sixth Amendent's
guarantee of a fair and impartial trial or could be prohibited by a
court in the exercise of its general supervisory powers. Despite the
enlightened trend of dissatisfaction with Swain,
the Solicitor General strenuously, and predictably, argued that a
defendant could not establish a constitutional violation by showing
"only" that blacks were systematically struck from the jury. The
argument failed to persuade the Court.
          In a second case, Turner v. Murray, the Court
held that a capital defendant accused of an interracial crime had a
constitutional right to have prospective jurors questioned about their
possible racial bias. In the final jury selection case, Vasquez v. Hillery, the Court reaffirmed existing law
that the exclusion of blacks from a grand jury was not harmless error,
but required a new trial no matter how old the original conviction
was.
          In the last of the racial discrimination cases, Thornburg v. Gingles, the Court construed for the
first time Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Congress amended
Section 2 in 1982 to provide that voting practices are unlawful if
they "result" in discrimination. Prior to 1982, an election law could
only be invalidated if minority plaintiffs showed that it was adopted
or was being maintained with a discriminatory purpose. The Court not
only affirmed the constitutionality of Section 2, but significantly
simplified the test for determining if an election plan using at-large
voting was unlawful.
          According to the Court, an apportionment plan violates Section 2 by
causing impermissible vote dilution if the plan permits a bloc-voting
white majority usually to defeat the candidates supported by a
politically and geographically cohesive minority. Factors such as a
lingering history of discrimination, racial campaign appeals, a
depressed minority socioeconomic status, etc., which Congress had
indicated in the legislative history were relevant to a vote dilution
claim, were held by the Court to be supportive of, but not essential
to, a Section 2 violation.
          The new test adopted by the Court to measure vote dilution based on
race is analogous to the one-person one-vote formulation that measures
vote dilution based on population inequality. Both focus on racial
patterns in election returns and in census data. Both avoid excesive
investigation into historical and social factors and contain readily
ascertainable standards for the lower courts to apply.
          Thornburg also held that plaintiffs were not required to show that
white voters were voting purposefully to exclude minorities from
office to establish bloc voting, and that the election of a token or
minimal number of blacks could not be used to defend an appointment
plan which worked usually to dilute the minority vote. The latter
ruling was a specific rejection of the Solictor General's argument in
the case that Section 2 protected only token--not equal--minority
political participation.
          Despite the fact that the Court as a whole reiterated its
commitment to racial equality this term, there was a significant
degree of division among the individual justices. Seven of the eight
discrimination cases were ideologically polarized, i.e., Brennan and
Marshall (the left wing of the court) voted together and took a
different position from that of Burger and Rehnquist (the right wing
of the court) on one or more major issues. (See Table I)

          The margin for victory for civil rights resulted from the
consistent support of the Brennan/Marshall position by Stevens and
Blackmun, and the inability of Burger and Rehnquist to hold the votes
of White, Powell, and O'Connor more than about half the time.
          The importance of the White/Powell/O'Connor bloc can be seen from
the fact that these three justices were more frequently in the
majority than any other members of the Court. As Table II shows,
O'Connor voted with the majority 89 percent of the time, and Powell
and White 75 percent of the time. Burger and Rehnquist voted most
frequently in the minority. (See Table II)

          Brennan, the senior exponent of the Court's liberal philosophy, was
suprisingly influential on the term's discrimination cases. He wrote
four of the eight majority opinions and was more frequently aligned
with the other justices than any other member of the Court. As Table
III shows, Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, Stevens and Powell voted
together at least half of the time. None of the other justices
approached that level of agreement. (See Table III)

                *To determine the frequency of agreement, the number of times
two members of the Court voted together was divided by the eight race
discrimination cases decided by the Court in which both justices
participated.  Justices were considered voting together only if they
joined the same opinion, concurrence or dissent.  Although justices
occasionally voted together more than once in a given case, their
alignment under such circumstances was given a value of
1. 
              
            
          
          The term's racial discrimination cases do not, of course, provide a
full picture of the Court's general treatment of civil and
constitutional claims. They also fail to show the Court's gross
disregard for the rights of politically more vulnerable minorities,
such as gays and Orthodox Jews. In Bowers
v. Hardwick, for example, the Court ruled that the Constitution
affords no protection from criminal prosecution to gays who
participate in homosexual acts in the privacy of their homes. In
another case, Goldman v. Weinberger the Court
held that the military could forbid an Orthodox Jew from wearing a
yarmulke, despite his sincere 

religious beliefs and the lack of any
service-related need.
          A court that turns its back on the deeply held beliefs of a
religous minority and leaves the regulation of intimate relationships
to the whim of a hostile majority, may in the long run provide scant
protection for the rights of racial minorities. President Reagan has
recently nominated the most ideologically inflexible member of the
Court, Justice Rehnquist, to be Chief Justice. He has also nominated
Antonin Scalia, another rigid conservative, to fill the vacancy
created by the resignation of current Chief Justice Burger. More
Reagan appointments would surely tilt the Court significantly to the
right, jeopardizing the continued constitutional protection of the
Nation's racial minorities.
